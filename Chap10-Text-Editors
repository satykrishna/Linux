Creating Files without Using an Editor
======================================

echo line one > myFile #will writes the line one to myFile
echo line two >> myFile #will append line two to myFile
echo line three >> myFile #will append line three to myFile

cat << $ENDSTRING > $FILENAME

The above methods would be helpful to create files in scripts.
